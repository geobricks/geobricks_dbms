Geobricks DBMS
==============

This project provides DBMS functionalities to Geobricks modules, enabling CRUD methods for different types of DB (e.g. [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), etc). The main class is ```dbms_core.py``` which acts as a generic gateway to the class that implements specific methods for each data source.
